## Step-by-Step Approach

### Step 1: Clarify Requirements (10-15 minutes)

**Essential Questions to Ask:**

**For any system:**
- What are the core functionalities required?
- What is the expected scale (users, data, requests)?
- Are there any performance requirements?
- Should we consider concurrent access?
- What are the input/output formats?

**For specific systems:**

**Chat Application:**
- How many users per chat room?
- Do we need message persistence?
- Should we support file sharing?
- Real-time notifications required?

**Booking System:**
- What types of bookings (hotel, flight, restaurant)?
- How do we handle double bookings?
- Do we need payment integration?
- Cancellation and modification policies?

**Cache System:**
- What eviction policy (LRU, LFU, FIFO)?
- Thread safety requirements?
- Persistence needed?
- Memory constraints?

### Step 2: High-Level Design (10-15 minutes)

**Design Template:**
```
1. Identify main components
2. Define data models
3. Design key interfaces
4. Choose data structures
5. Plan for scalability
```

**Example: LRU Cache Design**
```
Components:
- Cache Interface (get, put, remove)
- Node (doubly linked list)
- HashMap for O(1) access
- Capacity management

Data Structures:
- HashMap<Key, Node> for fast lookup
- Doubly linked list for LRU ordering

Key Operations:
- get(key): Move to head, return value
- put(key, value): Add to head, evict if needed
```

### Step 3: Implementation Strategy (40-50 minutes)

**Implementation Order:**
1. **Core data structures** (20 minutes)
2. **Basic operations** (15 minutes)
3. **Edge cases and validation** (10 minutes)
4. **Optimization and cleanup** (5 minutes)

**Code Structure Template:**
```java
// 1. Define interfaces and contracts
public interface CacheInterface<K, V> {
    V get(K key);
    void put(K key, V value);
    void remove(K key);
    int size();
}

// 2. Implement core data structures
public class LRUCache<K, V> implements CacheInterface<K, V> {
    private final int capacity;
    private final Map<K, Node<K, V>> cache;
    private final Node<K, V> head;
    private final Node<K, V> tail;
    
    // Constructor and helper methods
}

// 3. Implement main operations
// 4. Add error handling and edge cases
// 5. Optimize and refactor
```

### Step 4: Testing and Validation (10-15 minutes)

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Basic functionality works
- [ ] Edge cases handled (null, empty, boundary)
- [ ] Error conditions managed
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Thread safety (if required)

## Time Management Strategy

### 60-Minute Interview Breakdown

| Time | Phase | Activities | Key Focus |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| 0-10 min | Understanding | Requirements, clarifications | Don't rush to code |
| 10-20 min | Design | Architecture, interfaces | Get approval before coding |
| 20-50 min | Implementation | Core logic, edge cases | Working solution first |
| 50-60 min | Testing | Validation, complexity | Demonstrate thoroughness |

### Time-Saving Tips

**Do:**
- Start with the simplest working solution
- Use meaningful variable names from the start
- Write helper methods for complex logic
- Test as you go with simple examples

**Don't:**
- Over-engineer the initial solution
- Spend too much time on minor optimizations
- Implement features not explicitly required
- Write extensive comments during coding (explain verbally)

## Common Questions and Solutions

### 1. LRU Cache

**Problem:** Implement a Least Recently Used cache with O(1) get and put operations.

**Key Insights:**
- HashMap for O(1) access
- Doubly linked list for O(1) insertion/deletion
- Move accessed items to head
- Remove from tail when capacity exceeded

**Core Implementation:**
```java
public class LRUCache<K, V> {
    private final int capacity;
    private final Map<K, Node<K, V>> cache;
    private final Node<K, V> head, tail;
    
    public V get(K key) {
        Node<K, V> node = cache.get(key);
        if (node == null) return null;
        
        moveToHead(node);
        return node.value;
    }
    
    public void put(K key, V value) {
        Node<K, V> node = cache.get(key);
        
        if (node != null) {
            node.value = value;
            moveToHead(node);
        } else {
            Node<K, V> newNode = new Node<>(key, value);
            cache.put(key, newNode);
            addToHead(newNode);
            
            if (cache.size() > capacity) {
                Node<K, V> tail = removeTail();
                cache.remove(tail.key);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Problem:** Implement a rate limiter that allows N requests per time window.

**Key Insights:**

**Core Implementation:**
```java
public class TokenBucketRateLimiter {
    private final long capacity;
    private final long refillRate;
    private long tokens;
    private long lastRefillTime;
    
    public synchronized boolean allowRequest() {
        refillTokens();
        
        if (tokens > 0) {
            tokens--;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private void refillTokens() {
        long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long tokensToAdd = (now - lastRefillTime) * refillRate / 1000;
        tokens = Math.min(capacity, tokens + tokensToAdd);
        lastRefillTime = now;
    }
}
```

### 3. Chat Application

    private final Map<String, ChatRoom> rooms = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    private final Map<String, User> users = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    
    public String createRoom(String roomName, String creatorId) {
        String roomId = generateRoomId();
        ChatRoom room = new ChatRoom(roomId, roomName, creatorId);
        rooms.put(roomId, room);
        return roomId;
    }
    
    public void joinRoom(String roomId, String userId) {
        ChatRoom room = rooms.get(roomId);
        User user = users.get(userId);
        
        if (room != null && user != null) {
            room.addUser(user);
        }
    }
    
    public void sendMessage(String roomId, String userId, String content) {
        ChatRoom room = rooms.get(roomId);
        if (room != null && room.hasUser(userId)) {
            Message message = new Message(userId, content, System.currentTimeMillis());
            room.addMessage(message);
            notifyRoomUsers(room, message);
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Parking Lot System

**Problem:** Design a parking lot management system.

**Key Components:**
- Different vehicle types
- Parking spot allocation
- Fee calculation
- Entry/exit management

**Core Implementation:**
```java
public class ParkingLot {
    private final Map<VehicleType, List<ParkingSpot>> spots;
    private final Map<String, Ticket> activeTickets;
    
    public Ticket parkVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) {
        ParkingSpot spot = findAvailableSpot(vehicle.getType());
        if (spot == null) {
            throw new ParkingFullException("No available spots for " + vehicle.getType());
        }
        
        spot.parkVehicle(vehicle);
        Ticket ticket = new Ticket(generateTicketId(), vehicle, spot, System.currentTimeMillis());
        activeTickets.put(ticket.getId(), ticket);
        return ticket;
    }
    
    public double unparkVehicle(String ticketId) {
        Ticket ticket = activeTickets.remove(ticketId);
        if (ticket == null) {
            throw new InvalidTicketException("Invalid ticket: " + ticketId);
        }
        
        ticket.getSpot().removeVehicle();
        return calculateFee(ticket);
    }
}
```
